## Overview

Applied advanced Reinforcement Learning (RL) to solve a significant financial operations problem, leading to massive cost savings and efficiency gains for partnering banks.

## Model and Quantitative Impact

- **RL Implementation**: Developed an Offline RL model using a PyTorch Neural Network, enhanced with human-feedback-based learning to forecast cash flow needs at a granular branch level.
- **Cost Reduction**: The algorithm analyzed withdrawal patterns and consumer behavior, minimizing the bank's dependency on high-cost external funding by a staggering 60%.
- **Efficiency Gains**: The system also enhanced cash-hold capability by 50%. Separately, ML models trained on the same data enabled customer count prediction, reducing branch crowding by 20%.
- **Dashboard**: Integrated a multimodal data feed into a financial dashboard built on React for user-friendly visualization.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Deployment utilized AWS Lambda Functions for a scalable, cost-effective serverless backend.

## Technologies Used

- **Model**: Reinforcement Learning (Offline RL), PyTorch Neural Network.
- **Deployment**: React, AWS Lambda Functions.
- **Data**: Multimodal Data, Withdrawal Pattern Analysis.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was procuring data from partnering banks and extracting key hyperparameters. This involved setting up intelligent mapping between Figma components and React code structures, as well as managing edge cases like responsive design and conditional rendering. Additionally, the continuous synchronization required a robust error-handling system to prevent conflicts during development.

## Outcome

Forecasted cash flow needs and enhanced cash-hold capacity by 50%. Effectively minimized the bank's dependency on high-cost external funding by a staggering 60%. Furthermore, used the same data to train ML Models for customer count prediction. This enabled banks to downsize into a more efficient organization while reducing crowding by 20%
