## Overview

Advanced a Random Forest Regressor-based algorithm for seismic impact prediction using 110 years of satellite imagery (images and videos).

## Highlights

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Performed feature reduction to improve generalization and training efficiency.
- **API + Cloud**: Deployed the model via FastAPI and hosted inference on Google Cloud Functions.
- **Model Quality**: Implemented k-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to achieve a test-set accuracy of **97.5%**.

## Impact

Enables proactive disaster planning by forecasting seismic impact zones, with potential to mitigate loss of life and collateral damage.

## Stack

Python, scikit-learn, OpenCV, FastAPI, Google Cloud Functions
