## Overview

Engineered an AI-driven study portal utilizing Deep Learning and NLP (with fine-tuning) for adaptable content delivery across learners and curricula.

## Key Contributions

- **Real-time ETL Pipelines**: Accelerated data processing using Spark and Presto, enabling adaptive models to update on fresh activity signals.
- **Multimodal Learning**: Built a data layer for combined text, image, and video to personalize learning flows.
- **Personalization**: Leveraged transformers/LLMs and collaborative filtering for content-based recommendations.
- **Reliability at Speed**: Applied JIRA for agile delivery and QuickCheck-based property testing for robustness.

## Technologies Used

- Deep Learning, NLP fine-tuning, Transformers/LLMs, Collaborative Filtering
- Apache Spark, Presto, ETL Orchestration
- React (front-end integration), Next.js (app framework)

## Status

In progress; productionization focused on continuous evaluation and model monitoring.
